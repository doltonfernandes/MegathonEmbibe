Introduction


In previous units we have learnt about the properties related to single particle of matter, such as atomic size, ionization enthalpy, electronic charge density, molecular shape and polarity, etc.", "fibs": ["’"]}
{"text": "Most of the observable characteristics of chemical systems with which we are familiar represent bulk properties of matter, i.e., the properties associated with a collection of a large number of atoms, ions or molecules.", "fibs": ["chemical"]}
{"text": "For example, an individual molecule of a liquid does not boil but the bulk boils.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "Collection of water molecules have wetting properties; individual molecules do not wet.", "fibs": ["water"]}
{"text": "Water can exist as ice, which is a solid; it can exist as liquid; or it can exist in the gaseous state as water vapour or steam.", "fibs": ["ice"]}
{"text": "Physical properties of ice, water and steam are very different.", "fibs": ["ice"]}
{"text": "In all the three states of water chemical composition of water remains the same i.e., H2O.", "fibs": ["water"]}
{"text": "Characteristics of the three states of water depend on the energies of molecules and on the manner in which water molecules aggregate.", "fibs": ["water"]}
{"text": "Chemical properties of a substance do not change with the change of its physical state; but rate of chemical reactions do depend upon the physical state.", "fibs": ["substance"]}
{"text": "Many times in calculations while dealing with data of experiments we require knowledge of the state of matter.", "fibs": ["knowledge"]}
{"text": "Therefore, it becomes necessary for a chemist to know the physical laws which govern the behaviour of matter in different states.", "fibs": ["chemist"]}
{"text": "In this unit, we will learn more about these three physical states of matter particularly liquid and gaseous states.", "fibs": ["unit"]}
{"text": "To begin with, it is necessary to understand the nature of intermolecular forces, molecular interactions and effect of thermal energy on the  motion of particles because a balance between  these determines the state of a substance.", "fibs": ["nature"]}
{"text": "5.1	Intermolecular Forces
Intermolecular forces are the forces of attraction and repulsion between interacting particles (atoms and molecules).", "fibs": ["attraction"]}
{"text": "This term does not include the electrostatic forces that exist between the two oppositely charged ions and the forces that hold atoms of a molecule together i.e., covalent bonds.", "fibs": ["term"]}
{"text": "Attractive intermolecular forces are known as van der Waals forces, in honour of Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals (1837-1923), who explained the deviation of real gases from the ideal behaviour through these forces.", "fibs": ["honour"]}
{"text": "We will learn about this later in this unit.", "fibs": ["unit"]}
{"text": "van der Waals forces vary considerably in magnitude and include dispersion forces or London forces, dipole-dipole forces, and dipole-induced dipole forces.", "fibs": ["magnitude"]}
{"text": "A particularly strong type of dipole-dipole interaction is hydrogen bonding.", "fibs": ["type"]}
{"text": "Only a few elements can participate in hydrogen bond formation, therefore it is treated as a separate category.", "fibs": ["hydrogen"]}
{"text": "We have already learnt about this interaction in Unit 4.", "fibs": ["learnt"]}
{"text": "At this point, it is important to note that attractive forces between an ion and a dipole are known as ion-dipole forces and these are not van der Waals forces.", "fibs": ["point"]}
{"text": "5.1.1	 Dispersion Forces or London Forces 
Atoms and nonpolar molecules are electrically symmetrical and have no dipole moment because their electronic charge cloud is symmetrically distributed.", "fibs": ["nonpolar"]}
{"text": "Suppose we have two atoms ‘A’ and ‘B’  in the close vicinity of each other (Fig.", "fibs": ["‘"]}
{"text": "5.1a).", "fibs": ["5.1a"]}
{"text": "It may so happen that momentarily electronic charge distribution in one of the atoms, say ‘A’,  becomes unsymmetrical i.e., the charge cloud is more on one side than the other (Fig.", "fibs": ["charge"]}
{"text": "5.1 b and c).", "fibs": ["b"]}
{"text": "This results in the development of instantaneous dipole on the atom ‘A’ for a very short time.", "fibs": ["development"]}
{"text": "This instantaneous or transient dipole distorts the electron density of the other atom ‘B’, which is close to it and as a consequence a dipole is induced in the atom ‘B’.", "fibs": ["electron"]}
{"text": "The temporary dipoles of atom ‘A’ and ‘B’ attract each other.", "fibs": ["atom"]}
{"text": "This force of attraction was first proposed by the German physicist Fritz London, and for this reason force of attraction between two temporary dipoles is known as London force.", "fibs": ["force"]}
{"text": "Another name for this force is dispersion force.", "fibs": ["name"]}
{"text": "These forces are always attractive and interaction energy is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between two interacting particles (i.e., 1/r6 where r is the distance between two particles).", "fibs": ["interaction"]}
{"text": "These forces are important only at short distances (~500 pm) and their magnitude depends on the polarisability of the particle.", "fibs": ["~"]}
{"text": "Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "5.1.2	Dipole - Dipole Forces
Dipole-dipole forces act between the molecules possessing permanent dipole.", "fibs": ["act"]}
{"text": "Ends of the dipoles possess “partial charges” and these charges are shown by Greek letter delta (δ).", "fibs": ["letter"]}
{"text": "Partial charges are always less than the unit electronic charge (1.6×10–19 C).", "fibs": ["unit"]}
{"text": "Fig 5.2 (a) shows electron cloud distribution in the dipole of hydrogen chloride and Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "5.2 (b) shows dipole-dipole interaction between two HCl molecules.", "fibs": ["b"]}
{"text": "This interaction is stronger than the London forces but is weaker than ion-ion interaction because only partial charges are involved.", "fibs": ["interaction"]}
{"text": "The attractive force decreases with the increase of distance between the dipoles.", "fibs": ["force"]}
{"text": "As in the above case here also, the interaction energy is inversely proportional to distance between polar molecules.", "fibs": ["case"]}
{"text": "Dipole-dipole interaction energy between stationary polar molecules (as in solids) is proportional to 1/r3  and that between rotating polar molecules is proportional to 1/r 6, where r is the distance between polar molecules.", "fibs": ["interaction"]}
{"text": "Besides dipole-dipole interaction, polar molecules can interact by London forces also.", "fibs": ["interaction"]}
{"text": "Thus cumulative effect is that the total of intermolecular forces in polar molecules increase.", "fibs": ["effect"]}

5.1.3    	Dipole–Induced Dipole Forces
This type of attractive forces operate between the polar molecules having permanent dipole and the molecules lacking permanent dipole.", "fibs": ["electron"]}
{"text": "Permanent dipole of the polar molecule induces dipole on the electrically neutral molecule by deforming its electronic cloud (Fig.", "fibs": ["molecule"]}
{"text": "Thus an induced dipole is developed in the other molecule.", "fibs": ["molecule"]}
{"text": "In this case also interaction energy is proportional to 1/r6  where r is the distance between two molecules.", "fibs": ["case"]}
{"text": "Induced dipole moment depends upon the dipole moment present in the permanent dipole and the polarisability of the electrically neutral molecule.", "fibs": ["moment"]}

As already mentioned in section (5.1); this is special case of dipole-dipole interaction.", "fibs": ["interaction"]}

{"text": "Although hydrogen bonding is regarded as being limited to N, O and F; but species such as  may also participate in hydrogen bonding.", "fibs": ["hydrogen"]}
{"text": "Energy of hydrogen bond varies between 10 to 100 kJ mol–1.", "fibs": ["hydrogen"]}
{"text": "This is quite a significant amount of energy; therefore, hydrogen bonds are powerful force in determining the structure and properties of many compounds, for example proteins and nucleic acids.", "fibs": ["amount"]}
{"text": "Strength of the hydrogen bond is determined by the coulombic interaction between the lone-pair electrons of the electronegative atom of one molecule and the hydrogen atom of other molecule.", "fibs": ["Strength"]}
{"text": "Following diagram shows the formation of hydrogen bond.", "fibs": ["diagram"]}
{"text": "When two molecules are brought into close contact with each other, the repulsion between the electron clouds and that between the nuclei of two molecules comes into play.", "fibs": ["contact"]}
{"text": "Magnitude of the repulsion rises very rapidly as the distance separating the molecules decreases.", "fibs": ["Magnitude"]}
{"text": "This is the reason that liquids and solids are hard to compress.", "fibs": ["reason"]}
{"text": "In these states molecules are already in close contact; therefore they resist further compression; as that would result in the increase of repulsive interactions.", "fibs": ["contact"]}
{"text": "5.2  Thermal Energy
Thermal energy is the energy of a body arising from motion of its atoms or molecules.", "fibs": ["energy"]}
{"text": "It is directly proportional to the temperature of the substance.", "fibs": ["temperature"]}
{"text": "It is the measure of averagekinetic energy of the particles of the matter and is thus responsible for movement of particles.", "fibs": ["measure"]}
{"text": "This movement of particles is called thermal motion.", "fibs": ["movement"]}
{"text": "5.3	Intermolecular Forces vs Thermal Interactions
We have already learnt that intermolecular forces tend to keep the molecules together but thermal energy of the molecules tends to keep them apart.", "fibs": ["learnt"]}
{"text": "Three states of matter are the result of balance between intermolecular forces and the thermal energy of the molecules.", "fibs": ["matter"]}
{"text": "When molecular interactions are very weak, molecules do not cling together to make liquid or solid unless thermal energy is reduced by lowering the temperature.", "fibs": ["energy"]}
{"text": "Gases do not liquify on compression only, although molecules come very close to each other and intermolecular forces operate to the maximum.", "fibs": ["compression"]}
{"text": "However, when thermal energy of molecules is reduced by lowering the temperature; the gases can be very easily liquified.", "fibs": ["energy"]}

{"text": "It shields us from harmful radiations and contains substances like dioxygen, dinitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, etc.", "fibs": ["dioxygen"]}
{"text": "Let us now focus our attention on the behaviour of substances which exist in the gaseous state under normal conditions of temperature and pressure.", "fibs": ["focus"]}
