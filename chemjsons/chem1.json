{"text": "Let us start with the nature of matter.", "fibs": ["nature"]}
{"text": "1.2	Nature of Matter
You are already familiar with the term matter from your earlier classes.", "fibs": ["Matter"]}
{"text": "Anything which has mass and occupies space is called matter.", "fibs": ["Anything"]}
{"text": "Everything around us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are composed of matter.", "fibs": ["Everything"]}
{"text": "You know that they have mass and they occupy space.", "fibs": ["mass"]}
{"text": "Let us recall the characteristics of the states of matter, which you learnt in your previous classes.", "fibs": ["matter"]}
{"text": "1.2.1 States of Matter
You are aware that matter can exist in three physical states viz.", "fibs": ["Matter"]}
{"text": "solid, liquid and gas.", "fibs": ["gas"]}
{"text": "The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig.", "fibs": ["constituent"]}
{"text": "Particles are held very close to each other in solids in an orderly fashion and there is not much freedom of movement.", "fibs": ["fashion"]}
{"text": "In liquids, the particles are close to each other but they can move around.", "fibs": ["move"]}
{"text": "However, in gases, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast.", "fibs": ["movement"]}
{"text": "Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit the following characteristics:




Fig.", "fibs": ["arrangement"]}
{"text": "1.1	Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid and gaseous state




(i)	Solids have definite volume and definite shape.", "fibs": ["state"]}
{"text": "(ii)	Liquids have definite volume but do not have definite shape.", "fibs": ["ii"]}
{"text": "They take the shape of the container in which they are placed.", "fibs": ["shape"]}
{"text": "(iii)	Gases have neither definite volume nor definite shape.", "fibs": ["iii"]}
{"text": "They completely occupy the space in the container in which they are placed.", "fibs": ["space"]}
{"text": "These three states of matter are interconvertible by changing the conditions of temperature and pressure.", "fibs": ["matter"]}
{"text": "Solid  liquid  Gas
On heating, a solid usually changes to a liquid, and the liquid on further heating changes to gas (or vapour).", "fibs": ["heating"]}
{"text": "In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid.", "fibs": ["process"]}
{"text": "Classification of Matter
In class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that at the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be classified as mixture or pure substance.", "fibs": ["Classification"]}
{"text": "These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "When all constituent particles of a substance are same in chemical nature, it is said to be a pure substance.", "fibs": ["constituent"]}
{"text": "A mixture contains many types of particles.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "A mixture contains particles of two or more pure substances which may be present in it in any ratio.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "Hence, their composition is variable.", "fibs": ["composition"]}
{"text": "Pure sustances forming mixture are called its components.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "A mixture may be homogeneous or heterogeneous.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "In a homogeneous mixture, the components completely mix with each other.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "This means particles of components of the mixture are uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the mixture and its composition is uniform throughout.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "Sugar solution and air are the examples of homogeneous mixtures.", "fibs": ["solution"]}
{"text": "In contrast to this, in a heterogeneous mixture, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes different components are visible.", "fibs": ["contrast"]}
{"text": "For example, mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone pieces), are heterogeneous mixtures.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life.", "fibs": ["life"]}
{"text": "It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated by using physical methods, such as simplehand-picking, filtration, crystallisation, distillation, etc.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "1.2  Classification of matter




Pure substances have characteristics different from mixtures.", "fibs": ["matter"]}
{"text": "Constituent particles of pure substances have fixed composition.", "fibs": ["Constituent"]}
{"text": "Copper, silver, gold, water and glucose are some examples of pure substances.", "fibs": ["Copper"]}
{"text": "Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and its particles are of same composition.", "fibs": ["Glucose"]}
{"text": "Hence, like all other pure substances, glucose has a fixed composition.", "fibs": ["glucose"]}
{"text": "Also, its constituents—carbon, hydrogen and oxygen—cannot be separated by simple physical methods.", "fibs": ["constituents—carbon"]}
{"text": "Particles of an element consist of only one type of atoms.", "fibs": ["element"]}
{"text": "You may be familiar with atoms and molecules from the previous classes; however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2.", "fibs": ["detail"]}
{"text": "Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., are some examples of elements.", "fibs": ["Sodium"]}
{"text": "Their all atoms are of one type.", "fibs": ["type"]}
{"text": "However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature.", "fibs": ["nature"]}
{"text": "Some elements, such as sodium or copper, contain atoms as their constituent particles, whereas, in some others, the constituent particles are molecules which are formed by two or more atoms.", "fibs": ["sodium"]}
{"text": "For example, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules, in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "This is illustrated in Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "1.3  A representation of atoms and molecules




When two or more atoms of  different elements combine together in a definite ratio, the molecule of a compound is obtained.", "fibs": ["representation"]}
{"text": "Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods.", "fibs": ["compound"]}
{"text": "They can be separated by chemical methods.", "fibs": ["chemical"]}
{"text": "Examples of some compounds are water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc.", "fibs": ["water"]}
{"text": "The molecules of water and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig.", "fibs": ["water"]}
{"text": "Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "1.4	A depiction of molecules of water and carbon dioxide





Note that a water molecule comprises two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.", "fibs": ["depiction"]}
{"text": "Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with one carbon atom.", "fibs": ["molecule"]}
{"text": "Thus, the atoms of different elements are present in a compound in a fixed and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound.", "fibs": ["compound"]}
{"text": "Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements.", "fibs": ["compound"]}
{"text": "For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound formed by their combination i.e., water is a liquid.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher.", "fibs": ["note"]}
{"text": "1.3	Properties of Matter and their Measurement
1.3.1 Physical and chemical properties 
Every substance has unique or characteristic properties.", "fibs": ["Matter"]}
{"text": "These properties can be classified into two categories — physical properties, such as colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density, etc., and chemical properties, like composition, combustibility, ractivity with acids and bases, etc.", "fibs": ["—"]}
{"text": "Physical properties can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the substance.", "fibs": ["identity"]}
{"text": "The measurement or observation of chemical properties requires a chemical change to occur.", "fibs": ["measurement"]}
{"text": "Measurement of physical properties does not require occurance of a chemical change.", "fibs": ["occurance"]}
{"text": "The examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility, etc.", "fibs": ["chemical"]}
{"text": "Chemists describe, interpret and predict the behaviour of substances on the basis of knowledge of their physical and chemical properties, which are determined by careful measurement and experimentation.", "fibs": ["behaviour"]}
{"text": "In the following section, we will learn about the  measurement of physical properties.", "fibs": ["section"]}
{"text": "1.3.2 Measurement of physical properties
Quantitative measurement of properties is reaquired for scientific investigation.", "fibs": ["measurement"]}
{"text": "Many properties of matter, such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature.", "fibs": ["matter"]}
{"text": "Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured.", "fibs": ["observation"]}
{"text": "For example, length of a room can be represented as  6 m; here, 6 is the number and m denotes metre, the unit in which the length is measured.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "Earlier, two different systems of measurement, i.e., the English System and the Metric System were being used in different parts of the world.", "fibs": ["measurement"]}
{"text": "The metric system, which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system.", "fibs": ["system"]}
{"text": "Late, need of a common standard system was felt by the scientific community.", "fibs": ["need"]}
{"text": "Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed in detail below.", "fibs": ["system"]}
{"text": "Maintaining the National 
Standards of Measurement
The system of units, including unit definitions, keeps on changing with time.", "fibs": ["system"]}
{"text": "Whenever the accuracy of measurement of a particular unit was enhanced substantially by adopting new principles, member nations of metre treaty (signed in 1875), agreed to change the formal definition of that unit.", "fibs": ["accuracy"]}
{"text": "Each modern industrialised country, including India, has a National Metrology Institute (NMI), which maintains standards of measurements.", "fibs": ["country"]}
{"text": "This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi.", "fibs": ["responsibility"]}
{"text": "This laboratory establishes experiments to realise the base units and derived units of measurement and maintains National Standards of Measurement.", "fibs": ["laboratory"]}
{"text": "These standards are periodically inter-compared with standards maintained at other National Metrology Institutes in the world, as well as those, established at the International Bureau of Standards in Paris.", "fibs": ["world"]}
{"text": "1.3.3 The International System of Units (SI)

{"text": "1.3.4 Mass and Weight
Mass of a substance is the amount of matter present in it, while weight is the force exerted by gravity on an object.", "fibs": ["Weight"]}
{"text": "The mass of a substance is constant, whereas, its weight may vary from one place to another due to change in gravity.", "fibs": ["mass"]}
{"text": "The mass of a substance can be determined accurately in the laboratory by using an analytical balance (Fig.", "fibs": ["mass"]}
{"text": "The SI unit of mass as given in Table 1.1 is kilogram.", "fibs": ["SI"]}
{"text": "However, its fraction named as gram (1 kg = 1000 g), is used in laboratories due to the smaller amounts of chemicals used in chemical reactions.", "fibs": ["fraction"]}

1.3.5 Volume
Volume is the amont of space occupied by a substance.", "fibs": ["balance"]}
{"text": "It has the units of (length)3.", "fibs": ["length)3"]}
{"text": "So in SI system, volume has units of m3.", "fibs": ["SI"]}
