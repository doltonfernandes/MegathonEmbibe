{"text": "4.1 Rate of a Chemical Reaction


Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride.", "fibs": ["Reaction"]}
{"text": "On the other hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture.", "fibs": ["hand"]}
