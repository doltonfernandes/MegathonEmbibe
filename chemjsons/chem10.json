{"text": "5.1 Adsorption


There are several examples, which reveal that the surface of a solid has the tendency to attract and retain the molecules of the phase with which it comes into contact.", "fibs": ["surface"]}
{"text": "These molecules remain only at the surface and do not go deeper into the bulk.", "fibs": ["surface"]}
{"text": "The accumulation of molecular species at the surface rather than in the bulk of a solid or liquid is termed adsorption.", "fibs": ["accumulation"]}
{"text": "The molecular species or substance, which concentrates or accumulates at the surface is termed adsorbate and the material on the surface of which the adsorption takes place is called adsorbent.", "fibs": ["species"]}
{"text": "Adsorption is essentially a surface phenomenon.", "fibs": ["surface"]}
{"text": "Solids, particularly in finely divided state, have large surface area and therefore, charcoal, silica gel, alumina gel, clay, colloids, metals in finely divided state, etc.", "fibs": ["state"]}
{"text": "act as good adsorbents.", "fibs": ["act"]}
{"text": "Adsorption in action
(i) If a gas like O2, H2, CO, Cl2, NH3 or SO2 is taken in a closed vessel containing powdered charcoal, it is observed that the pressure of the gas in the enclosed vessel decreases.", "fibs": ["action"]}
{"text": "The gas molecules concentrate at the surface of the charcoal, i.e., gases are adsorbed at the surface.", "fibs": ["gas"]}
{"text": "(ii) In a solution of an organic dye, say methylene blue, when animal charcoal is added and the solution is well shaken, it is observed that the filtrate turns colourless.", "fibs": ["ii"]}
{"text": "The molecules of the dye, thus, accumulate on the surface of charcoal, i.e., are adsorbed.", "fibs": ["dye"]}
{"text": "(iii) Aqueous solution of raw sugar, when passed over beds of animal charcoal, becomes colourless as the colouring substances are adsorbed by the charcoal.", "fibs": ["iii"]}
{"text": "(iv) The air becomes dry in the presence of silica gel because the water molecules get adsorbed on the surface of the gel.", "fibs": ["iv"]}
{"text": "It is clear from the above examples that solid surfaces can hold the gas or liquid molecules by virtue of adsorption.", "fibs": ["gas"]}
{"text": "The process of removing an adsorbed substance from a surface on which it is adsorbed is called desorption.", "fibs": ["process"]}
{"text": "5.1.1 Distinction between Adsorption and Absorption


In adsorption, the substance is concentrated only at the surface and does not penetrate through the surface to the bulk of the adsorbent, while in absorption, the substance is uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the solid.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "For example, when a chalk stick is dipped in ink, the surface retains the colour of the ink due to adsorption of coloured molecules while the solvent of the ink goes deeper into the stick due to absorption.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "On breaking the chalk stick, it is found to be white from inside.", "fibs": ["chalk"]}
{"text": "A distinction can be made between absorption and adsorption by taking an example of water vapour.", "fibs": ["distinction"]}
{"text": "Water vapours are absorbed by anhydrous calcium chloride but adsorbed by silica gel.", "fibs": ["calcium"]}
{"text": "In other words, in adsorption the concentration of the adsorbate increases only at the surface of the adsorbent, while in absorption the concentration is uniform throughout the bulk of the solid.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "Both adsorption and absorption can take place simultaneously also.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "The term sorption is used to describe both the processes.", "fibs": ["term"]}
{"text": "5.1.2 Mechanism of Adsorption


Adsorption arises due to the fact that the surface particles of the adsorbent are not in the same environment as the particles inside the bulk.", "fibs": ["fact"]}
{"text": "Inside the adsorbent all the forces acting between the particles are mutually balanced but on the surface the particles are not surrounded by atoms or molecules of their kind on all sides, and hence they possess unbalanced or residual attractive forces.", "fibs": ["adsorbent"]}
{"text": "These forces of the adsorbent are responsible for attracting the adsorbate particles on its surface.The extent of adsorption increases with the increase of surface area per unit mass of the adsorbent at a given temperature and pressure.", "fibs": ["adsorbent"]}
{"text": "Another important factor featuring adsorption is the heat of adsorption.", "fibs": ["factor"]}
{"text": "During adsorption, there is always a decrease in residual forces of the surface, i.e., there is decrease in surface energy which appears as heat.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "Adsorption, therefore, is invariably an exothermic process.", "fibs": ["process"]}
{"text": "In other words, ∆H of adsorption is always negative.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "When a gas is adsorbed, the freedom of movement of its molecules become restricted.", "fibs": ["gas"]}
{"text": "This amounts to decrease in the entropy of the gas after adsorption, i.e., ∆S is negative.", "fibs": ["decrease"]}
{"text": "Adsorption is thus accompanied by decrease in enthalpy as well as decrease in entropy of the system.", "fibs": ["decrease"]}
{"text": "For a process to be spontaneous, the thermodynamic requirement is that, at constant temperature and pressure, ∆G must be negative, i.e., there is a decrease in Gibbs energy.", "fibs": ["process"]}
{"text": "On the basis of equation, ∆G = ∆H – T∆S, ∆G can be negative if ∆H has sufficiently high negative value as – T∆S is positive.", "fibs": ["basis"]}
{"text": "Thus, in an adsorption process, which is spontaneous, a combination of these two factors makes ∆G negative.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "As the adsorption proceeds, ∆H becomes less and less negative ultimately ∆H becomes equal to T∆S and ∆G becomes zero.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "At this state equilibrium is attained.", "fibs": ["state"]}
{"text": "5.1.3 Types of Adsorption




There are mainly two types of adsorption of gases on solids.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "If accumulation of gas on the surface of a solid occurs on account of weak van der Waals’ forces, the adsorption is termed as physical adsorption or physisorption.", "fibs": ["accumulation"]}
{"text": "When the gas molecules or atoms are held to the solid surface by chemical bonds, the adsorption is termed chemical adsorption or chemisorption.", "fibs": ["gas"]}
{"text": "The chemical bonds may be covalent or ionic in nature.", "fibs": ["chemical"]}
{"text": "Chemisorption involves a high energy of activation and is, therefore, often referred to as activated adsorption.", "fibs": ["energy"]}
{"text": "Sometimes these two processes occur simultaneously and it is not easy to ascertain the type of adsorption.", "fibs": ["type"]}
{"text": "A physical adsorption at low temperature may pass into chemisorption as the temperature is increased.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "For example, dihydrogen is first adsorbed on nickel by van der Waals’ forces.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "Molecules of hydrogen then dissociate to form hydrogen atoms which are held on the surface by chemisorption.", "fibs": ["hydrogen"]}
{"text": "Some of the important characteristics of both types of adsorption are described below:
Characteristics of physisorption
(i) Lack of specificity: A given surface of an adsorbent does not show any preference for a particular gas as the van der Waals’ forces are universal.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "(ii) Nature of adsorbate: The amount of gas adsorbed by a solid depends on the nature of gas.", "fibs": ["ii"]}
{"text": "In general, easily liquefiable gases (i.e., with higher critical temperatures) are readily adsorbed as van der Waals’ forces are stronger near the critical temperatures.", "fibs": ["’"]}
{"text": "Thus, 1g of activated charcoal adsorbs more sulphur dioxide (critical temperature 630K), than methane (critical temperature 190K) which is still more than 4.5 mL of dihydrogen (critical temperature 33K).", "fibs": ["1g"]}
{"text": "(iii) Reversible nature: Physical adsorption of a gas by a solid is generally reversible.", "fibs": ["iii"]}
{"text": "Thus,



      More of gas is adsorbed when pressure is increased as the volume of the gas decreases (Le–Chateliers’s principle) and the gas can be removed by decreasing pressure.", "fibs": ["gas"]}
{"text": "Since the adsorption process is exothermic, the physical adsorption occurs readily at low temperature and decreases with increasing temperature (Le-Chatelier’s principle).", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "(iv) Surface area of adsorbent: The extent of adsorption increases with the increase of surface area of the adsorbent.", "fibs": ["iv"]}
{"text": "Thus, finely divided metals and porous substances having large surface areas are good adsorbents.", "fibs": ["surface"]}
{"text": "(v) Enthalpy of adsorption: No doubt, physical adsorption is an exothermic process but its enthalpy of adsorption is quite low (20–40 kJ mol-1).", "fibs": ["v"]}
{"text": "This is because the attraction between gas molecules and solid surface is only due to weak van der Waals’ forces.", "fibs": ["attraction"]}
{"text": "Characteristics of chemisorption
(i) High specificity: Chemisorption is highly specific and it will only occur if there is some possibility of chemical bonding between adsorbent and adsorbate.", "fibs": ["chemisorption"]}
{"text": "For example, oxygen is adsorbed on metals by virtue of oxide formation and hydrogen is adsorbed by transition metals due to hydride formation.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "(ii) Irreversibility: As chemisorption involves compound formation, it is usually irreversible in nature.", "fibs": ["ii"]}
{"text": "Chemisorption is also an exothermic process but the process is very slow at low temperatures on account of high energy of activation.", "fibs": ["process"]}
{"text": "Like most chemical changes, adsorption often increases with rise of temperature.", "fibs": ["chemical"]}
{"text": "Physisorption of a gas adsorbed at low temperature may change into chemisorption at a high temperature.", "fibs": ["gas"]}
{"text": "Usually high pressure is also favourable for chemisorption.", "fibs": ["pressure"]}
{"text": "(iii) Surface area: Like physical adsorption, chemisorption also increases with increase of surface area of the adsorbent.", "fibs": ["iii"]}
{"text": "(iv) Enthalpy of adsorption: Enthalpy of chemisorption is high (80-240 kJ mol-1) as it involves chemical bond formation.", "fibs": ["iv"]}

5.1.4 Adsorption Isotherms


The variation in the amount of gas adsorbed by the adsorbent with pressure at constant temperature can be expressed by means of a curve termed as adsorption isotherm.", "fibs": ["Table"]}
{"text": "Freundlich adsorption isotherm: Freundlich, in 1909, gave an empirical relationship between the quantity of gas adsorbed by unit mass of solid adsorbent and pressure at a particular temperature.", "fibs": ["adsorption"]}
{"text": "The relationship can be expressed by the following equation:
 = k.p1/n (n > 1)                                                                          ...(5.1)
where x is the mass of the gas adsorbed on mass m of the adsorbent at pressure P, k and n are constants which depend on the nature of the adsorbent and the gas at a particular temperature.", "fibs": ["relationship"]}
{"text": "The relationship is generally represented in the form of a curve where mass of the gas adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent is plotted against pressure (Fig.", "fibs": ["relationship"]}
{"text": "These curves indicate that at a fixed pressure, there is a decrease in physical adsorption with increase in temperature.", "fibs": ["pressure"]}
{"text": "These curves always seem to approach saturation at high pressure.", "fibs": ["approach"]}

The validity of Freundlich isotherm can be verified by plotting log  on y-axis (ordinate) and log p on x-axis (abscissa).", "fibs": ["log"]}
{"text": "If it comes to be a straight line, the Freundlich isotherm is valid, otherwise not (Fig.", "fibs": ["line"]}
{"text": "The slope of the straight line gives the value of .", "fibs": ["slope"]}
{"text": "The intercept on the y-axis gives the value of log k.
Freundlich isotherm explains the behaviour of adsorption in an approximate manner.", "fibs": ["intercept"]}
{"text": "The factor  can have values between 0 and 1 (probable range 0.1 to 0.5).", "fibs": ["factor"]}
{"text": "Thus, equation (5.2) holds good over a limited range of pressure.", "fibs": ["equation"]}
{"text": "Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "5.2: Freundlich isotherm
When = 0, = constant, the adsorption is independent of pressure.", "fibs": ["isotherm"]}
{"text": "When = 1, = k p, i.e.", "fibs": ["k"]}
{"text": "∝ p, the adsorption varies directly with pressure.", "fibs": ["∝"]}
{"text": "The experimental isotherms always seem to approach saturation at high pressure.", "fibs": ["approach"]}

Solids can adsorb solutes from solutions also.", "fibs": ["Phase"]}
{"text": "When a solution of acetic acid in water is shaken with charcoal, a part of the acid is adsorbed by the charcoal and the concentration of the acid decreases in the solution.", "fibs": ["solution"]}
{"text": "Similarly, the litmus solution when shaken with charcoal becomes colourless.", "fibs": ["litmus"]}
{"text": "The precipitate of Mg(OH)2 attains blue colour when precipitated in presence of magneson reagent.", "fibs": ["Mg(OH)2"]}

{"text": "The following observations have been made in the case of adsorption from solution phase:
(i) The extent of adsorption decreases with an increase in temperature.", "fibs": ["case"]}
{"text": "(ii) The extent of adsorption increases with an increase of surface area of the adsorbent.", "fibs": ["ii"]}
{"text": "(iii) The extent of adsorption depends on the concentration of the solute in solution.", "fibs": ["iii"]}
{"text": "(iv) The extent of adsorption depends on the nature of the adsorbent and the adsorbate.", "fibs": ["iv"]}
{"text": "The precise mechanism of adsorption from solution is not known.", "fibs": ["mechanism"]}
{"text": "Freundlich’s equation approximately describes the behaviour of adsorption from solution with a difference that instead of pressure, concentration of the solution is taken into account, i.e.,
 = kC1/n                                                                                          ...(5.3)

log = logk + logC                                                                       ...(5.4)

Plotting log  against log C a straight line is obtained which shows the validity of Freundlich isotherm.", "fibs": ["logarithm"]}

Important features of solid catalysts
(a) Activity
The activity of a catalyst depends upon the strength of chemisorption to a large extent.", "fibs": ["formation"]}

Colloidal solutions when prepared, generally contain excessive amount of electrolytes and some other soluble impurities.", "fibs": ["Purification"]}

(i) Dialysis: It is a process of removing a dissolved substance from a colloidal solution by means of diffusion through a suitable membrane.Since particles (ions or smaller molecules) in a true solution can pass through animal membrane (bladder) or parchment paper or cellophane sheet but not the colloidal particles, the membrane can be used for dialysis.", "fibs": ["purification"]}

{"text": "(iii) Colour: The colour of colloidal solution depends on the wavelength of light scattered by the dispersed particles.", "fibs": ["iii"]}
{"text": "The wavelength of light further depends on the size and nature of the particles.", "fibs": ["wavelength"]}

{"text": "When two or more ions are present in the dispersion medium, preferential adsorption of the ion common to the colloidal particle usually takes place.", "fibs": ["dispersion"]}
{"text": "This can be explained by taking the following examples:
(a) When highly diluted solution of silver nitrate is added to highly diluted potassium iodide solution, the precipitated silver iodide adsorbs iodide ions from the dispersion medium and negatively charged colloidal sol results.", "fibs": ["solution"]}
{"text": "However, when KI solution is added to AgNO3 solution, positively charged sol results due to adsorption of Ag+ ions from dispersion medium.", "fibs": ["KI"]}
{"text": "(b) If FeCl3 is added to the excess of hot water, a positively charged sol of hydrated ferric oxide is formed due to adsorption of Fe3+ ions.", "fibs": ["b"]}

{"text": "Fig.", "fibs": ["Fig"]}
{"text": "5.13 depicts the formation of double layer.", "fibs": ["formation"]}
{"text": "Since separation of charge is a seat of potential, the charges of opposite signs on the fixed and diffused parts of the double layer results in a difference in potential between these layers in the same manner as potential difference is developed in a capacitor.", "fibs": ["separation"]}

{"text": "This repulsion prevents their close approach.", "fibs": ["repulsion"]}
{"text": "They remain dispersed and colloid is stabilised.", "fibs": ["colloid"]}
{"text": "The addition of more electrolytes to sol supresses the diffused double layer and reduces the zita potential.", "fibs": ["addition"]}

{"text": "If, somehow, the charge is removed, the particles will come nearer to each other to form aggregates (or coagulate) and settle down under the force of gravity.", "fibs": ["charge"]}
{"text": "The process of settling of colloidal particles is called coagulation or precipitation of the sol.", "fibs": ["process"]}
{"text": "The coagulation of the lyophobic sols can be carried out in the following ways:
(i) By electrophoresis: The colloidal particles move towards oppositely charged electrodes, get discharged and precipitated.", "fibs": ["coagulation"]}
{"text": "(ii) By mixing two oppositely charged sols: Oppositely charged sols when mixed in almost equal proportions, neutralise their charges and get partially or completely precipitated.", "fibs": ["ii"]}
{"text": "Mixing of hydrated ferric oxide (+ve sol) and arsenious sulphide (–ve sol) bring them in the precipitated forms.", "fibs": ["ferric"]}
{"text": "This type of coagulation is called mutual coagulation.", "fibs": ["type"]}
{"text": "(iii) By boiling: When a sol is boiled, the adsorbed layer is disturbed due to increased collisions with the molecules of dispersion medium.", "fibs": ["iii"]}
{"text": "This reduces the charge on the particles and ultimately leads to settling down in the form of a precipitate.", "fibs": ["charge"]}
{"text": "(iv) By persistent dialysis: On prolonged dialysis, traces of the electrolyte present in the sol are removed almost completely and the colloids become unstable and ultimately coagulate.", "fibs": ["iv"]}
{"text": "(v) By addition of electrolytes: When excess of an electrolyte is added, the colloidal particles are precipitated.", "fibs": ["v"]}
{"text": "The reason is that colloids interact with ions carrying charge opposite to that present on themselves.", "fibs": ["reason"]}
{"text": "This causes neutralisation leading to their coagulation.", "fibs": ["neutralisation"]}
{"text": "The ion responsible for neutralisation of charge on the particles is called the coagulating ion.", "fibs": ["ion"]}
{"text": "A negative ion causes the precipitation of positively charged sol and vice versa.", "fibs": ["ion"]}
{"text": "It has been observed that, generally, the greater the valence of the flocculating ion added, the greater is its power to cause precipitation.", "fibs": ["valence"]}
{"text": "This is known as Hardy-Schulze rule.", "fibs": ["rule"]}
{"text": "In the coagulation of a negative sol, the flocculating power is in the order: Al3+>Ba2+>Na+
Similarly, in the coagulation of a positive sol, the flocculating power is in the order: [Fe(CN)6]4– > PO43– > SO42– > Cl–
The minimum concentration of an electrolyte in millimoles per litre required to cause precipitation of a sol in two hours is called coagulating value.", "fibs": ["coagulation"]}
{"text": "The smaller the quantity needed, the higher will be the coagulating power of an ion.", "fibs": ["quantity"]}
{"text": "Coagulation of lyophilic sols
There are two factors which are responsible for the stability of lyophilic sols.", "fibs": ["lyophilic"]}
{"text": "These factors are the charge and solvation of the colloidal particles.", "fibs": ["charge"]}
{"text": "When these two factors are removed, a lyophilic sol can be coagulated.", "fibs": ["lyophilic"]}
{"text": "This is done (i) by adding an electrolyte and (ii) by adding a suitable solvent.", "fibs": ["electrolyte"]}
{"text": "When solvents such as alcohol and acetone are added to hydrophilic sols, the dehydration of dispersed phase occurs.", "fibs": ["alcohol"]}
{"text": "Under this condition, a small quantity of electrolyte can bring about coagulation.", "fibs": ["condition"]}
{"text": "Protection of colloids
Lyophilic sols are more stable than lyophobic sols.", "fibs": ["lyophobic"]}
{"text": "This is due to the fact that lyophilic colloids are extensively solvated, i.e., colloidal particles are covered by a sheath of the liquid in which they are dispersed.", "fibs": ["fact"]}
{"text": "Lyophilic colloids have a unique property of protecting lyophobic colloids.", "fibs": ["property"]}
{"text": "When a lyophilic sol is added to the lyophobic sol, the lyophilic particles form a layer around lyophobic particles and thus protect the latter from electrolytes.", "fibs": ["lyophilic"]}
{"text": "Lyophilic colloids used for this purpose are called protective colloids.", "fibs": ["purpose"]}
{"text": "5.5 Emulsions
These are liquid-liquid colloidal systems, i.e., the dispersion of finely divided droplets in another liquid.", "fibs": ["dispersion"]}
{"text": "If a mixture of two immiscible or partially miscible liquids is shaken, a coarse dispersion of one liquid in the other is obtained which is called emulsion.", "fibs": ["mixture"]}
{"text": "Generally, one of the two liquids is water.", "fibs": ["water"]}
{"text": "(i) Oil dispersed in water (O/W type) and

Emulsions of oil in water are unstable and sometimes they separate into two layers on standing.", "fibs": ["oil"]}
{"text": "For stabilisation of an emulsion, a third component called emulsifying agent is usually added.", "fibs": ["stabilisation"]}
{"text": "The emulsifying agent forms an interfacial film between suspended particles and the medium.", "fibs": ["agent"]}
