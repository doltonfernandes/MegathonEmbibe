2.1  Introduction
Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally accepted reference standard called unit.", "fibs": ["Chapter"]}
{"text": "The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.", "fibs": ["result"]}
{"text": "Although the number of physical quantities appears to be very large, we need only a limited number of units for expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-related with one another.", "fibs": ["number"]}

{"text": "The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows :
•	In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively.", "fibs": ["base"]}
{"text": "•	In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively.", "fibs": ["•"]}
{"text": "•	In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively.", "fibs": ["•"]}
{"text": "The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale d’ Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI.", "fibs": ["system"]}
{"text": "The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, was developed and recommended by General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971 for international usage in scientific, technical, industrial and commercial work.", "fibs": ["SI"]}
{"text": "Because SI units used decimal system, conversions within the system are quite simple and convenient.", "fibs": ["SI"]}
{"text": "We shall follow the SI units in this book.", "fibs": ["SI"]}
{"text": "In SI, there are seven base units as given in Table 2.1.", "fibs": ["SI"]}
{"text": "Besides the seven base units, there are two more units that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid angle dΩ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the spherical surface, described about the apex O as the centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in Fig.", "fibs": ["base"]}

{"text": "2.3  Measurement of Length
You are already familiar with some direct methods for the measurement of length.", "fibs": ["Length"]}
{"text": "For example, a metre scale is used for lengths from 10–3 m to 102 m.  A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an accuracy of 10–4 m.  A screw gauge and a spherometer can be used to measure lengths as less as to 10–5 m. To measure lengths beyond these ranges, we make use of some special indirect methods.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "2.3.1  Measurement of Large Distances
Large distances such as the distance of a planet or a star from the earth cannot be measured directly with a metre scale.", "fibs": ["distance"]}

2.3.2 Estimation of Very Small Distances: Size of a Molecule
To measure a very small size, like that of a molecule (10–8 m to 10–10 m), we have to adopt special methods.", "fibs": ["Answer"]}
{"text": "We cannot use a screw gauge or similar instruments.", "fibs": ["use"]}
{"text": "Even a microscope has certain limitations.", "fibs": ["microscope"]}
{"text": "An optical microscope uses visible light to ‘look’ at the system under investigation.", "fibs": ["microscope"]}

{"text": "For visible light the range of wavelengths  is from about 4000 Å to 7000 Å  (1 angstrom = 1 Å = 10-10 m).", "fibs": ["light"]}
{"text": "Hence an optical microscope cannot resolve particles with sizes smaller than this.", "fibs": ["microscope"]}
{"text": "Instead of visible light, we can use an electron beam.", "fibs": ["light"]}
{"text": "The resolution of such an electron microscope is limited finally by the fact that electrons can also behave as waves !", "fibs": ["resolution"]}
{"text": "(You will learn more about this in class XII).", "fibs": ["class"]}
{"text": "The wavelength of an electron can be as small as a fraction of an angstrom.", "fibs": ["wavelength"]}
{"text": "Such electron microscopes with a resolution of 0.6 Å have been built.", "fibs": ["electron"]}

{"text": "In recent times, tunnelling microscopy has been developed in which again the limit of resolution is better than an angstrom.", "fibs": ["microscopy"]}
{"text": "It is possible to estimate the sizes of molecules.", "fibs": ["estimate"]}
{"text": "A simple method for estimating the molecular size of oleic acid is given below.", "fibs": ["method"]}
{"text": "Oleic acid is a soapy liquid with large molecular size of the order of 10–9 m.
	The idea is to first form mono-molecular layer of oleic acid on water surface.", "fibs": ["acid"]}
{"text": "We dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to make a solution of 20 cm3.", "fibs": ["cm3"]}
{"text": "Then we take 1 cm3 of this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using  alcohol.", "fibs": ["cm3"]}

{"text": "The oleic acid drop spreads into a thin, large and roughly circular film of molecular thickness on water surface.", "fibs": ["oleic"]}
{"text": "Then, we quickly measure the diameter of the thin film to get its area A.", "fibs": ["measure"]}

{"text": "Assume tip of the pin to be in the range 10–5m to 10–4m.", "fibs": ["tip"]}
{"text": "Answer  The size of a nucleus is in the range of 10–15 m and 10–14 m.  The tip of a sharp pin is taken to be in the range of 10–5 m and 10–4 m. Thus we are scaling up by a factor of 1010.", "fibs": ["Answer"]}
{"text": "An atom roughly of size 10–10 m will be scaled up to a size of 1 m. Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small in size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the centre of a sphere of radius about a metre long.", "fibs": ["atom"]}

2.4  Measurement of Mass
Mass is a basic property of matter.", "fibs": ["fermi"]}

Mass of commonly available objects can be determined by a common balance like the one used in a grocery shop.", "fibs": ["case"]}

2.5   Measurement of time
To measure any time interval we need a clock.", "fibs": ["Table"]}
{"text": "We now use an atomic standard of time, which is based on the periodic vibrations produced in a cesium atom.", "fibs": ["use"]}
{"text": "This is the basis of the cesium clock, sometimes called atomic clock, used in the national standards.", "fibs": ["basis"]}
{"text": "In the cesium atomic clock, the second is taken as the time needed for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of cesium-133 atom.", "fibs": ["cesium"]}
{"text": "The vibrations of the cesium atom regulate the rate of this cesium atomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance wheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the vibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a quartz wristwatch.", "fibs": ["cesium"]}
{"text": "The cesium atomic clocks are very accurate.", "fibs": ["cesium"]}
{"text": "In principle they provide portable standard.", "fibs": ["principle"]}
{"text": "The national standard of time interval ‘second’ as well as the frequency is maintained through four cesium atomic clocks.", "fibs": ["time"]}
{"text": "A cesium atomic clock is used at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi to  maintain the Indian standard of time.", "fibs": ["cesium"]}
{"text": "In our country, the NPL has the responsibility of maintenance and improvement of physical standards, including that of time, frequency, etc.", "fibs": ["country"]}
{"text": "Note that the Indian Standard Time (IST) is linked to this set of atomic clocks.", "fibs": ["IST"]}
{"text": "The efficient cesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they impart the uncertainty in time realisation as ± 1 × 10–13, i.e.", "fibs": ["cesium"]}
{"text": "1 part in 1013.", "fibs": ["part"]}
{"text": "This implies that the uncertainty gained over time by such a device is less than 1 part in 1013; they lose or gain no more than 3 µs in one year.", "fibs": ["uncertainty"]}
{"text": "In view of the tremendous accuracy in time measurement, the SI unit of length has been expressed in terms the path length light travels in certain interval of time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 2.1).", "fibs": ["view"]}
{"text": "The time interval of events that we come across in the universe vary over a very wide range.", "fibs": ["time"]}

Measurement is the foundation of all experimental science and technology.", "fibs": ["Accuracy"]}

{"text": "The accuracy of a measurement is a measure of how close the measured value is to the true value of the quantity.", "fibs": ["accuracy"]}
{"text": "Precision tells us to what resolution or limit the quantity is measured.", "fibs": ["resolution"]}
{"text": "The accuracy in measurement may depend on several factors, including the limit or the resolution of the measuring instrument.", "fibs": ["accuracy"]}
{"text": "For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "In one experiment, using a measuring instrument of resolution 0.1 cm, the measured value is found to be 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm, the length is determined to be 3.38 cm.", "fibs": ["experiment"]}
{"text": "The first measurement has more accuracy (because it is closer to the true value) but less precision (its resolution is only 0.1 cm), while the second measurement is less accurate but more precise.", "fibs": ["measurement"]}

{"text": "In general, the errors in measurement can be broadly classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors.", "fibs": ["measurement"]}
{"text": "Table 2.5   Range and order of time intervals






Systematic errors
The systematic errors are those errors that tend to be in one direction, either positive or negative.", "fibs": ["Table"]}
{"text": "Some of the sources of systematic errors are :
(a) 	Instrumental errors that arise from the errors due to imperfect design or calibration of the measuring instrument, zero error in the instrument, etc.", "fibs": ["design"]}
{"text": "For example, the temperature graduations of a thermometer may be inadequately calibrated (it may read 104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP whereas it should read 100 °C); in a vernier callipers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may be worn off at one end.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "(b) 	Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure To determine the temperature of a human body, a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature.", "fibs": ["b"]}
{"text": "Other external conditions (such as changes in temperature, humidity, wind velocity, etc.)", "fibs": ["temperature"]}

{"text": "(c) 	Personal errors that arise due to an individual’s bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus or individual’s carelessness in taking observations without observing proper precautions, etc.", "fibs": ["’"]}
{"text": "For example, if you, by habit, always hold your head a bit too far to the right while reading the position of a needle on the scale, you will introduce an error due to parallax.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "Systematic errors can be minimised by improving experimental techniques, selecting better instruments and removing personal bias as far as possible.", "fibs": ["bias"]}
{"text": "For a given set-up, these errors may be estimated to a certain extent and the necessary corrections may be applied to the readings.", "fibs": ["set-up"]}
{"text": "Random errors
The random errors are those errors, which occur irregularly and hence are random with respect to sign and size.", "fibs": ["respect"]}
{"text": "unpredictable fluctuations in temperature, voltage supply, mechanical vibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal (unbiased) errors by the observer taking readings, etc.", "fibs": ["temperature"]}
{"text": "For example, when the same person repeats the same observation, it is very likely that he may get different readings everytime.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "Least count error
The smallest value that can be measured by the measuring instrument is called its least count.", "fibs": ["count"]}
{"text": "All the readings or measured values are good only up to this value.", "fibs": ["value"]}
{"text": "The least count error is the error associated with the resolution of the instrument.", "fibs": ["count"]}
{"text": "For example, a vernier callipers has the least count as 0.01cm; a spherometer may have a least count of 0.001 cm.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "Least count error belongs to the category of random errors but within a limited size; it occurs with both systematic and random errors.", "fibs": ["count"]}
{"text": "If we use a metre scale for measurement of length, it may have graduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or interval.", "fibs": ["use"]}
{"text": "Using instruments of higher precision, improving experimental techniques, etc., we can reduce the least count error.", "fibs": ["precision"]}

 l = 16.2 ± 0.1  cm

 b = 10.1  ± 0.1 cm

 This leads us to quote the final result as

{"text": "(2) If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also be valid to n significant figures.", "fibs": ["result"]}

{"text": "For example, 12.9 g – 7.06 g, both specified to three significant figures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted).", "fibs": ["example"]}

{"text": "The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity.", "fibs": ["quantity"]}
{"text": "Note that using the square brackets [  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing with ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.", "fibs": ["square"]}
{"text": "For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths.", "fibs": ["example"]}
{"text": "Hence the dimensions of volume are [L] × [L] × [L] = [L]3 = [L3].", "fibs": ["volume"]}

{"text": "Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as
Force   = mass × acceleration

	The dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]2 =            [M L T–2].", "fibs": ["force"]}

{"text": "2.9	Dimensional formulae and dimensional equations
The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity is called the dimensional formula of the given physical quantity.", "fibs": ["expression"]}

       [(1/2) a t2] = [L T–2] [T2]

As each term on the right hand side of this equation has the same dimension, namely that of length, which is same as the dimension of left hand side of the equation, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct equation.", "fibs": ["term"]}
{"text": "It may be noted that a test of consistency of dimensions tells us no more and no less than a test of consistency of units, but has the advantage that we need not commit ourselves to a particular choice of units, and we need not worry about conversions among multiples and sub-multiples of the units.", "fibs": ["test"]}
