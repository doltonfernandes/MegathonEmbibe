{"text": "The following compounds of molecular masses 58 and 60 are ranked in order of increasing boiling points.", "fibs": ["order"]}
{"text": "The lower members of aldehydes and ketones such as methanal, ethanal and propanone are miscible with water in all proportions, because they form hydrogen bond with water.", "fibs": ["propanone"]}
